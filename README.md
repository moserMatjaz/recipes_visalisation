Dependency Wheel
================

This experiment visualizes package dependencies using an interactive disc. Each disc section represents a dependency, and links between arcs materialize these dependencies. All rendering is done client-side, in JavaScript. Built with <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">d3.js</a>, published with the MIT open-source license.

Interact with DependencyWheels, see examples, and build your own at [http://fzaninotto.github.com/DependencyWheel](http://fzaninotto.github.com/DependencyWheel).
