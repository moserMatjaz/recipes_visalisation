          Welcome to my summer.<br><br>
          This web site is built to represent the work I did as an intern at Sabanci University in Istanbul. The table on the left side can be used for navigation through the page. The site provides information about myself and also about the project. For those more interested there is PDF document available for download.The main purpose of the site is to visualize the work we have done during the project. At the bottom you will find external links and references used, mostly for the report. <br><br>

        <h2><a name="me"></a>About me:</h2>
        <p class = "normal_text">I am coming from a small town in Slovenia. It is a small town in a small country on the sunny side of Alps, they say. I was born on 8th of August 1989 in Kranj. I attended primary school in my hometown. All my further education has since then moved to Kranj (high school and University). Currently I am a Masters student at the University of Maribor. <br> <br>
        The rest of my CV is available here. <br> <br>
        My primary field of studies is IT and the ways to manage and govern IT support in companies. I did my undergraduate thesis on comparison of different open source CRM tools and graduate thesis is still under construction. <br> <br>
        In 2014 I decided that I want some international experience so I embarked myself to Istanbul as an exchange student at Sabanci University. Probably one the most scary decisions that I have ever made, but most the best one beyond any doubt. Well, needless to say that SU is a great University and during the time that I was there, one year and one week, I learned a lot and. Without any hesitation I would recommend SU to all exchange and full time students seeking for a stimulative environment in one of the greatest cities in the world
        I have spent two semesters there and I also did my internship under the mentorship of one of the professors. MY internship lasted for three months and was fully funded by Erasmus+ program. And this page is the final result of this internship. <br> <br>
        In my spare time I enjoy myself in nature by doing all sorts of outdoor activities (mainly climbing and hiking) as any other person I enjoy a good book and a good movie. And like many CS and IT people I am a big fan of The Lord of the Rings.

        <h2><a name="proj"></a>About the project:</h2>
        <p class = "normal_text">
          Here, a short presentation of the project will be given. Full report is available here. All the data used, code, queries and other materials can be obtained from my GitHub repository [add link] <br><br>
          This website is a result of my internship at Sabanci University in Istanbul, Turkey. I was an exchange student there and I was also given the opportunity to do my internship in the summer months. In total I have spent one year and one week in Istanbul, every day a great delight. <br><br>
          I have always been interested in data and databases but had little knowledge beyond the traditional relational model and SQL. This internship / project was a great opportunity to expand my knowledge to more recent field in the data sciences. <br><br>
          With this short text we would like to present, to the reader, the summary of our work from the start until the end within short paragraph. For interested readers we also provide a full text in which our work is described in detail. <br><br>

        <h3><a name="Data"></a>Data:</h3>
        <p class = "normal_text">
        There were many ideas on what the topic of the project should be. We had the general framework set (very general: get some data and do something with it) but what kind of data. There was talk about reference datasets and protein-to-protein interaction but in the end we decided to do the work on recipes. It is more fun. <br><br>
        The data set was acquired here [link] and it needed much restructuring and beauty procedures. After we got the data ready we imported it in Neo4j [link]. This is the part where I was given the opportunity to expand my knowledge. I had no idea what Neo4j is or what graph databases are. I must say I was intrigued instantly.  <br><br>
        Once the data was in the database we started querying it using Cypher [link]. I must admit<br> that at first I was quite lost but once you get the hang of it, it gets really fun. We were thinking of doing the majority of work in Neo4j but our system setup had some limitations, see full text, that were unacceptable for us so we did the majority of heavy lifting with scripting language – Python. <br><br>
        <h3><a name="Code"></a>Code:</h3>
        <p class = "normal_text">
        As mentioned before, most of the heavy lifting was done outside of the database, using Python [link]. Our main idea was to calculate the similarities between cuisines using the raw data from recipes (procedure explanation in full text – chapter references). For the purpose of this we devised three different methods. These three different methods were then compared and tested. In the end the fastest one was chosen to be the calculating method for our cuisine similarities. <br><br>
        A rough description of our similarity would be: two recipes are more similar if they contain more mutual ingredients- Two cuisines are more similar if they contain recipes that are similar. This basically means that every recipe had to be compared to all others (given the dataset of 57691 recipes,this was not such an easy job) and time was of the essence. <br><br>After some long hours the code presented us with output. Results were promising and were imported to our databases using standard CSV import procedures. <br><br>

        <h3><a name="Visualsiation"></a>Visualisation:</h3>
        <p class = "normal_text">
          Presenting the results of our work turned out to be the hardest thing to do. Prior to this internship I had little experience with web development and JavaScript [link] in particular. Well, that changed. <br><br>
          There is a lot of different parameters that could be shown in the world map, our time was limited so we decided to show the results of our similarity calculations. <br><br>
          The results are displayed in a map since all the data is geographically oriented. We used D3.js [link] and with data from TopoJSON [link] we devised a map that upon click shows most similar cuisines, to the clicked one, from our dataset. <br><br>
          Not all data is there (a lot of countries are missing from the dataset) but the ones that are there perform pretty well. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h3><a name="Website"></a>Website:</h3>
        <p class = "normal_text">
          Once the data part, coding and visualisation parts were finished there was time to build a web site. Main idea of the website is to present our project in the broadest way possible (no details). <br><br>
          The site is built using standard HTML framework with combination of CSS and some animations written in JavaScript. Not much can be said about it so just take a tour and decide for yourself. <br><br>
          </p>
        <h3>Database comparisson:</h3>
        <p class = "normal_text">
          I am pretty familiar with the relational database model and have acquainted myself only recently, with the graph model. I have seen a lot of nice word being said about the performance of Neo4j compared to relational databases so we ran some tests. <br><br>
          We build two databases (on in Neo4j and the second one in MySQL) containing the same data with the same data model (as equal as possible). On this databases pre written queries were ran (in Cypher and SQL). Execution time was the most important parameter of the comparison because all other parameters are beyond the scope of our little project. The other parameters (if not observed by ourselves) were derived from literature and contain security, ease of programing, maturity etc. <br><br>
